# Algorithms and data structures #
This repository will contain labs from algorithms and data structures class. Solutions correctness and time complexity are verified with tests. Each lab contains problem description, tests and solution class.
### Topics and fields of labs: ###
1. [Data stuctures] - `Simple list`, `Sorted list`, `moveToHeadList` (list, where last used element is always moved to head).
2. [Dynamic Programming] - Finding optimal solution for the game with two players.
3. [Graphs] - `Square graph`, `Line graph`, `Coloring` and `Strong Coloring` of graph.
